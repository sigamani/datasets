That means we can choose any time that works for everyone else without issues for her.\n\nNext, Helen has no meetings the whole day. So she's completely free and can attend at any time.\n\nArthur also has no meetings all day, similar to Helen. He's flexible and can join whenever needed.\n\nNow, Ethan has several meetings on Monday:\n- 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM\n- 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM\n- 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM\n- 13:30 PM (1:30 PM) to 15:00 PM (3:00 PM)\nSo, Ethan is busy from 9:00 AM until 3:00 PM\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 13:00 - 13:30}"}

Let me start by looking at each person's schedule and constraints.\n\nFirst, Heather has blocked several time slots on her calendar for Monday:\n- 9:00 to 9:30\n- 10:30 to 11:00\n- 13:00 to 14:00 (which is 1 PM to 2 PM)\n- 14:30 to 15:00 (2:30 PM to 3 PM)\n- 16:00 to 16:30 (4 PM to 4:30 PM)\n\nSo Heather has these specific times blocked. That means the meeting can't be in any of those slots.\n\nNicholas doesn't have any meetings all day, so he's completely free from 9 AM to 5 PM. That’s helpful because it gives us more flexibility for scheduling.\n\nZachary has a more complex schedule:\n- He's busy from 9:00 to 10:30 AM\n- Then again from 11:00 to 12:00 PM (noon)\n- From 12:30 PM to\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 12:00 - 12:30}"}

On Tuesday, he's busy in the morning and late afternoon. On Wednesday, his schedule is blocked from 14:30 to 16:00.\n\nNow, Nicole's constraints:\n- She's completely blocked on Monday and Tuesday from 9:00 to 17:00.\n- On Wednesday, she's free from 9:30 to 9:30 (wait, that doesn't make sense.

The meeting should last half an hour. Let me start by looking at their schedules and constraints.\n\nTheresa has no meetings the whole day, so she's completely free from 9:00 to 17:00. That gives her a lot of flexibility. On the other hand, Helen is busy during several time slots:\n\n- 9:30 to 13:00\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 14:30 to 15:00\n- 15:30 to 17:00\n\nSo, Helen's schedule is pretty packed from 9:30 onwards. She also mentioned she would rather not meet on Monday after 13:30. That adds another constraint that the meeting shouldn't be scheduled after 13:30.\n\nLet me break down the time slots:\n\nFrom 9:00 to 9:30, both Theresa and Helen are free because Helen starts her first busy slot at 9:30. So, maybe they can meet right at 9:00 or a bit before? But wait, the earliest they can start is 9:00,\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 13:00 - 13:30}"}

On the other hand, Ashley has a lot of busy times spread across different days. The goal is to find a half-hour window that works for both without conflicting with their schedules.\n\nLooking at Ashley's constraints, I should break down each day:\n\n- **Monday**: She's busy from 9:30-10:00, 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, and 16:00-17:00. So the free time on Monday would be before 9:30, between 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, after 13:30 until 16:00, and after 17:00. But since meetings are during work hours (9:00-17:00), the available slots on Monday would be from 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, and 13:30-16:00.\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Tuesday, 9:30 - 10:00}"}

Let me see what the constraints are here.\n\nFirst, the meeting needs to be half an hour long between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday. That gives us a window from 9:30 to 16:30 since the meeting can't start before 9:30 if it's going to end by 10:00.\n\nNow, looking at Brenda's schedule: she has meetings from 9:30 to 10:00 and again from 11:30 to 12:30. She also has a longer block from 14:00 to 16:30. So her available slots are between 10:00 to 11:30, and then after 16:30 she's free until the end of the day at 17:00.\n\nBenjamin doesn't want to meet on Monday after 9:30. That means he's available from 9:00 onwards but preferably before 9:30 if possible. But since the meeting can't start before 9:30, maybe they have to wait until after that.

The meeting should last half an hour. Let me start by looking at their existing schedules and constraints.\n\nFirst, Patricia has blocked her calendar on Monday from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM. That means she's busy during those two time slots. So the meeting can't be scheduled in any of those times.\n\nNext, Harold has a lot more meetings on Monday. He's booked from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM, then again from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and another from 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM. After that, he's free until 1:30 PM but has a meeting from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. He also has a meeting from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Additionally, Harold prefers not to meet after 2:00 PM, so the latest we can consider is 2:00 PM.\n\nLet me list out all the time slots that are available for both Patricia and\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 13:00 - 13:30}"}

The key points are that the meeting must fit within these work hours for both participants, and each has existing schedules that we need to respect.\n\nLooking at Sophia's schedule, it's completely open throughout the day. That means she doesn't have any meetings or commitments from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Monday. So, any time slot within those hours should work for her.\n\nNow, let's check Jesse's schedule.

After that, he's free until... well, actually, his schedule doesn't specify any other times except for Monday morning. So Elijah is available from 10:00 AM onwards, but he doesn't want to meet after 3:00 PM (15:00). That means the latest we can have the meeting is at 15:30 or earlier.\n\nBeverly's schedule is a bit more detailed.

It says he's completely open the entire day, so that gives me a lot of flexibility for his time. That’s good because it means I don't have to worry about conflicting times with him as long as I find a time that works for Elizabeth and Sandra.\n\nNow, looking at Elizabeth's schedule: she has meetings on Monday from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM, then again from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, another block from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, then 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM, and finally from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM.

On the other hand, Cheryl has blocked several time slots on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nCheryl's blocked times on Monday are from 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, and 15:30 to 17:00. So, she's busy during those periods. On Tuesday, her blocked times are from 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 15:00 to 15:30, as well as 16:00 to 17:00.\n\nAdditionally, Charles doesn't want to meet on Monday. So, the meeting can't be scheduled on Monday at all. Also, he prefers that the meeting takes place after 15:30 on Tuesday.\n\nSo, putting this together, we need a\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Tuesday, 14:00 - 14:30}"}

He also mentioned that he doesn't want to meet before 13:00, which is 1 PM.\n\nMelissa has blocks from 10:30-13:00 (which is 10:30 AM to 1 PM), 14:00-14:30 (2 PM - 2:30 PM), and 15:30-16:30 (3:30 PM - 4:30 PM).\n\nSo, first, I should list out all the possible one-hour time slots between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM and check which ones are available for both Kenneth and Melissa.\n\nLet me break it down by each hour:\n\nStarting from 9:00 AM:\n- 9:00-10:00: Kenneth is busy\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 13:00 - 14:00}"}

So, on both days, he's busy during specific slots. Maria, on the other hand, has a lot more blocked times. She's busy every morning from 9:00 to 9:30 up until 12:00, then again from 12:30 to 14:30, and in the afternoons from 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, and 16:30 to 17:00 on both Monday and Tuesday. Plus, she doesn't want to meet on Tuesday at all.\n\nSo, since Maria doesn't want to meet on Tuesday, the meeting has to be on Monday. That narrows down our options to Monday only.

So he can attend any time that works for others.\n\n- **Catherine**: She is busy from 12:00 to 12:30 PM and again from 3:00 to 3:30 PM. She also mentioned she'd rather not meet before 2:00 PM, so her preferred start times are after 14:00 (which is 2:00 PM).\n\n- **Rachel**: Her schedule is quite packed. She has meetings from 9:00 to 9:30 AM, then again from 10:00 to 11:00 AM and 11:30 to 12:00 PM. After that, she's free until 12:30 PM, but she's busy from 12:30 to 1:00 PM, then again from 2:00 to 3:00 PM and 4\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 16:00 - 16:30}"}

Let me list them out:\n\n- 9:00 to 10:00\n- 11:30 to 12:00\n- 12:30 to 13:00\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 14:30 to 16:00\n\nSo Frank is booked from 9 AM until 10 AM, then again from 11:30 to 12, 12:30 to 1 PM, 1:30 to 2 PM, and finally from 2:30 PM to 4 PM.\n\nI need to find a one-hour window where both Carol and Frank are free. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nCarol is available starting at 14:30. So the meeting can't be before that. Now, looking at Frank's schedule\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 16:00 - 17:00}"}

On the other hand, Kelly has blocked several time slots each day. I need to check which days are possible based on Kelly's availability and the constraints.\n\nThe meeting needs to be one hour long during work hours, so between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The days available for the meeting are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. But there are some additional constraints:\n\n1. Megan cannot meet on Wednesday.\n2. Kelly would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00.\n\nSo, let me break down each day and see when both can meet.\n\nStarting with Monday:\n- Kelly's blocked times on Monday are from 10:00-11:30, 13:00-14:00, and 16:00-17:00.\n- So her available slots on Monday would be before 10:00 or between 14:00-16:00.\n- Since the meeting needs to be\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 11:30 - 12:30}"}

Wait, actually, looking again, I see that on Tuesday, Larry is blocked from 9:00 to 9:30, but that's it? Or does he have more? Hmm, no, according to his constraints, Tuesday only has a block from 9:00-9:30. So the rest of Tuesday is free except for that initial block.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I misread. Let me check again:\n\nLarry's blocks on Tuesday are 9:00 to 9:30 and 12:30 to 17:00. Oh, right, so he's busy from 9:00-9:30 and then from 12:30-5 PM?

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the constraints provided. Benjamin is available all week, so his calendar is wide open. That means any time between 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday works for him.\n\nVincent's schedule is more complicated. He has specific busy periods each day:\n\n- **Monday**:\n- 9:00-9:30\n- 10:00-11:00\n- 12:00-13:30\n- 14:30-15:00\n- 15:30-17:00\n\nSo on Monday, Vincent is busy from 9:00 to 17:00 except for a break between 13:30 and 14:30. Wait, no, looking again, his busy times are 9:00-9:30, then 10:00-11:00, then 12:00-13:30, then 14:30-15:00, and finally 15:30-17:00.

She has blocked times from 9:30 to 10:00 AM and again from 12:30 to 1:00 PM. So her busy periods are in the morning and midday. That means she's free before 9:30 AM and after 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM.\n\nNext, Albert has no meetings the whole day. So he's completely available from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. He doesn't have any blocked times, which is great because it gives us more flexibility.\n\nNow, Nathan has three meeting blocks: 9:00 to 12:30 PM, 1:00 to 2:30 PM, and 4:00 to 5:00 PM. So his day is pretty packed with meetings, but there are some gaps where he might be available.

Wait, no, the instruction says between 9:00 to 17:00. So Frank doesn't have any blocks on Monday, right? Because his blocks are only on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n- On Tuesday, he's blocked in two intervals, so available otherwise.\n- On Wednesday, again, blocked in two intervals.\n\nNow Judy's schedule:\nShe has a lot more blocks. Let me list them by day:\n\nMonday:\n- 9:00 to 14:30\n- 15:00 to 16:30\n\nTuesday:\n- 10:00 to 10:\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Tuesday, 9:00 - 9:30}"}

So that's the whole day on Monday.\n- **Tuesday**: He has meetings at 9:00 to 11:30, then again at 13:00 to 13:30, another block from 14:00 to 15:30, and finally from 16:00 to 17:00. So he's busy in the morning and late afternoon on Tuesday.\n- **Wednesday**: He’s free from 9:00 to 9:30 and then from 10:00 to 17:00. That means he has a short break at the start of Wednesday and is otherwise busy.\n\nSince Heather can meet any time, I need to find an overlap where Dennis is available on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n\nLet me check each day:\n\n**Monday**: Dennis is fully booked from 9:00 to 17:00.

Then after 15:30 until 16:00, and again from 17:00 onwards.\n\nBenjamin is busy from 9:00-9:30 and 10:00-10:30. So his first break is between 10:30-11:00.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the days we're considering: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The meeting needs to be half an hour long between 9:00 to 17:00, so that gives us a window from 9:30 to 16:30 for potential start times.\n\nLooking at Megan's constraints, she has blocked several time slots each day. On Monday, she's busy from 15:00 to 15:30. So the latest they can start on Monday is before 15:00 or after 15:30, but since it's a half-hour meeting, starting at 14:30 would end at 15:00, which might still be okay if Megan isn't busy until 15:00. Wait, no, her block starts at 15:00, so maybe they can start at 14:30? Or perhaps earlier.\n\nOn Tuesday, Megan has blocks at 9:30-10:00 and 11:30-12:00 and 15:30-16:00.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the constraints for both Anna and Mary.\n\nAnna is available on either Monday or Tuesday during work hours (9:00 to 17:00). But she can't meet on Monday because of her schedule. So, Anna must be available only on Tuesday.\n\nMary, on the other hand, has a more complex schedule. Let me break down Mary's busy times:\n\n- **Monday**:\n- 9:30 to 12:00\n- 13:00 to 14:30\n- 15:30 to 16:00\n- 16:30 to 17:00\n\n- **Tuesday**:\n- 9:00 to 11:30\n- 12:00 to 13:00\n- 13:30 to 14:00\n- 14:30 to 15:30\n- 16:00 to 17:00\n\nSo, Mary is busy on both Monday and Tuesday but has some free slots.

So her available slots would be before 12:30 PM and between 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM. Since the meeting is one hour, let's see if there are any gaps that can fit.\n\nAnna has no meetings all day, so she's completely free from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. That's a big help because it means we just need to find a time that works for the others and fits within Anna's schedule as well.\n\nVirginia has blocked times at 9:00-10:00 AM, 11:30 AM to 4:00 PM, and 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM. So her available slots are from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM and between 4:00 PM to\n\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 10:00 - 11:00}"}

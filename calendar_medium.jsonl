Here are a few example tasks and solutions: You need to schedule a meeting for Sarah, Russell, Michael, Charles, Heather and Sharon for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nSarah is busy on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 15:00 to 15:30; \nRussell's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nMichael has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 11:30; \nCharles is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nHeather has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nSharon is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: Reason your way to find the best time that works for everyone's schedule, or if not the best possible outcome.}\n### Input:\n{CONSTRAINTS: }\n", "response": "{Reasoning: Let's consider the constraints carefully before making a decision.

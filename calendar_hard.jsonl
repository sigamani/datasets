You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions: You need to schedule a meeting for Bruce, Vincent, Austin, Diane, Juan and Joseph for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nBruce's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nVincent has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAustin is free the entire day.\nDiane is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nJuan has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nJoseph has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 15:00; \n\nAustin would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: Reason your way to find the best time that works for everyone's schedule, or if not the best possible outcome.}\n### Input:\n{CONSTRAINTS: }\n", "response": "{Reasoning: Let's consider the constraints carefully before making a decision. We'll identify feasible time slots or travel plans based on the given input. This reasoning will guide us to the best outcome.\n\n{Here is the proposed time: Monday, 11:00 - 11:30}", "level": "hard"}
